Here is my script file: 
#!/bin/bash

echo "Jenkins Environment:"
env

ACTION="$ACTION"  # Ensure ACTION is set to the correct value
USERNAME="$USERNAME"  # Ensure USERNAME is set to the correct value

echo "ACTION: $ACTION"
echo "USERNAME: $USERNAME"

case "$ACTION" in
  "create")
    echo "Creating user $USERNAME"
    # Add your command to create the user here
    ;;
  "delete")
    echo "Deleting user $USERNAME"
    # Add your command to delete the user here
    ;;
  "lock")
    echo "Locking user $USERNAME"
    # Add your command to lock the user here
    ;;
  "unlock")
    echo "Unlocking user $USERNAME"
    # Add your command to unlock the user here
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid action: $ACTION"
